## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
ProBettor is a Data Science project aimed at exploring the domain of sports analysis and betting, with the goal of assisting in making informed decisions when placing bets and more.
While allowing contributors to improve and share their knowlegdge of data science, machine learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

## Context
Today, sports betting is one of the most widely practiced forms of gambling worldwide, with online betting sites multiplying and continually attracting new enthusiasts.\
They offer sports fans an immersive and exciting experience while generating significant revenue. However, this growing popularity also raises concerns such as gambling addiction and financial losses.

## Approach
We collect historical data (matches, players, team performances).\
Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we identify trends, patterns, and key factors that can influence match outcomes. Then, we develop prediction models using machine learning algorithms that are trained and evaluated to measure their accuracy and reliability.

## Artificial Intelligence for a Healthy Environment
We are aware of the risks associated with sports betting, especially for young individuals.\
Through AI, we could propose a responsible betting scheme and provide educational resources on the subject to prevent compulsive gambling behavior. Our goal is to raise awareness of these issues and provide prevention measures for a responsible gaming experience.
